                <h3>background</h3>
                <p>my uncle doug has had a greeting card business for years and he had spoke to me before about turning it into an e-card business. as soon as i was given the christmas e-card brief, uncle doug’s e-card had it’s time to shine.</p>
                <h3>challenge</h3>
                <p>interpreting his greeting card into a full story with additional graphics.</p>
                <h3>solution</h3>
                <p>a twist on the original with the poor dog being taken out of his warm abode and into the original blistery snowstorm scene. i interpreted uncle doug’s illustrations into vector graphics and created a few other graphics that match the theme. i experimented with transitions, masks, and tweens to tell the story with classic e-card flare.</p>
                <h3>impact</h3>
                <p>a christmas card ready to send off to all our frenemies come december 2017 and a very smug uncle doug.</p>
